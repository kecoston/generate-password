## How does it work? 

When the user clicks on the generate password link, they are presented with a series of prompts that create the criteria for the password. The prompts will set the length of the password, and whether the user would like to use uppercase or lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. Once the criteria is selected, the characters are pulled at random from their exisiting variable, based off of the select length, and then fed into a new array.
