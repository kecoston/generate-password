# Generate a Password

- About -
For this project, we were requested to create a series of prompts that would determine the parameters for a password that would be 8- 128 characters long. We were provided with the HTML and CSS for the project and build off of the Javascript file. 

- Process - 
My first step was to create all the variables for the project, including what strings would be pulled into the array, the prompts, and confirms to gather the user's parameters. The open array to collect the user's parameters. After the variables were set, my next thought was that I needed a collection of if/else statements to currently pull in the strings that were selected by the user to create the array. After I made the series of if/else statements, I created the function for which would randomly select the characters from the built array, based on the length of the password requested by the user. I then reviewed my code and thought I could make them if/else statements into a function of their own since they seemed repetitive.

- Where I Struggled- 
With this project, I struggled the most with figuring out the language I needed to use to make the if/else statements and function. Conceptually I knew that was what needed to be done, but figuring out how to make it happen left me stuck. I was also unable to figure out how to code it so the prompts would not start until the user selected the generate button.
